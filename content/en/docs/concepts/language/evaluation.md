What does it mean that values are also constraints.

Examples:

- a list is a struct with integer keys where it is enforced that the
  cardinality of the struct equal that of the key with the highest number.


- order of evaluation
- lazy
- cycles

If you haven't read the section on value lattices yet and want to
understand evaluation, now is a good time to read it.
Especially understanding default values is quite important.
