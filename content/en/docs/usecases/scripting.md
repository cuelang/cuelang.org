CUE has a powerful scripting layer.

More on this later.

For now, we refer to the documentation included in the CUE tool itself:
```
$ cue help cmd
```
or the "Define Commands" section of the
[Kubernetes Tutorial](https://cue.googlesource.com/cue/+/refs/heads/master/doc/tutorial/kubernetes/README.md).
