Struct is the most important composite type in CUE.

A struct may be open or closed.
A closed struct may only be merged with structs that have fields that
it defines to be allowed.
In other words, closing a struct is equivalent to requiring that all
other values be undefined.

A closed struct can be created using the `closed` builtin,
but are more commonly defined using a _definition_, defined next.
